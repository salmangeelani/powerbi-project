Data professional survey breakdown

This Power BI project analyzes survey data collected by Alex the Analyst, a renowned YouTuber, in 2022. The dataset comprises 630 unique responses from data professionals across various countries, including the United States (261), India (73), the United Kingdom (40), Canada (32), and others (224).

A country-wise analysis revealed intriguing insights: respondents in the United States (63.8%) and Canada (60.6%) reported having a better work-life balance compared to those in other countries. Additionally, salary satisfaction was notably higher among professionals in the US. In contrast, only 35.1% of the 73 respondents from India expressed satisfaction with their salaries.

Interestingly, the data also highlighted that most professionals perceived breaking into the field of data as moderately challengingâ€”neither too easy nor too difficult.
